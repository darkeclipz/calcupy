# 24-12-2018

 - Added support for up to three parameters.
 - Most functions now also return the `out_expression` which allows you to view the result.
 - Added polar plots (requires a function of one variable).
 - Polar plot is activated when `phi`, `Phi`, `theta`, `Theta`, `r` or `R` is the variable.
 - Unordered list for displaying a list of action results.
 - Basic graph information (as a list).
 - Integrate with respect to any variable.

# 23-12-2018

 - Added graph plotting with Graphviz.
 - Complement of a graph.
 - Degree matrix of a graph.
 - Minimum spanning tree of a graph.
 - Changed arrow style for gradient plots.
 - Added support to re-evaluate the result of an action.

# 20-12-2018
